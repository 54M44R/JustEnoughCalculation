# Just Enough Calculation Mod

Hey, this is a small add on to [NEI-GTNH-2.1](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/NotEnoughItems) (Not Enough Items), in
order to help you calculate the amount of resources to craft a specific amount of item. .

This might be a little confusing, here's a example:

- you want to know how many wood log do you need to craft 40 stairs, simply load the recipe you want to use and it will
tell you 13 logs should be enough, that's all. 

This mod is focused on calculation so you might find it powerful and high performance in some complicated cases. Have fun!
