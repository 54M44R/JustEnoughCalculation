# Just Enough Calculation Mod

Hey, this is a small add on to JEI (Just Enough Items), in order to help you
calculate the amount of resources to craft
a specific amount of item. This might be a little confusing, here's a example:
you want to know how many wood log do you need to craft 40 stairs, simply
load the recipe you want to use and it will tell you 13
logs should be enough, that's all. This mod is focused on calculation so
you might find it powerful and high - performance in some complicated
cases. Have fun!
